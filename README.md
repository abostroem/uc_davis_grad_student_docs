uc_davis_grad_student_docs
==========================

This is a document that we wish we know when we were an incoming grad student in the Physics
Department at UC Davis

2014 values are indented below the bullet

Money
__________

* You are paid monthly.
	- paychecks started on Nov 1 (classes started Oct 2)

* Your fees will not be paid until school starts

* If you are already in repayment, you cannot defer your student loans until your fees
are paid and classes have started

* Scholarships/Fellowships are paid in monthly installments starting with your first paycheck

* Any fees you have due will be deducted from your first paycheck

* Travel reimbursement will be reimbursed in the first paycheck

* Travel reimbursement is calculated based on receipts or airline miles from your origin.

	-reimbursement is ~$0.50/mile

Prelim
---------------

* The prelim is an exam you are expected to pass at the beginning of your second year

* The prelim contains typical undergraduate and graduate level materials

* The prelim is taken over 4 days, 3 hours each day

* The first 2 days are the "classical section", covering Classical Mechanics, E+M, Mathematical Methods

* The second 2 days are the "quantum section", covering Quantum Mechanics, Stat Mech, and Laboratory Methods

* You can pass the 2 sections independently

* All 3 subjects in both sections will be on both days of that section

* Prelims are offered once a year, usually the week before orientation

* The 2013 exam was considered easy

* The prelim is qualitatively scored, so the same exam score does not pass every year

* You are given 3 chances to pass your prelim

* You have to pass the prelim before the beginning of your 3rd year

* It is highly recommended (but not required) that you take the prelim the week before you start classes

* You will not be penalized for not passing your prelim your first year

* It is recommended you reserve Physics rm 185 the week before the exam to study

* The dates of the prelim are not determined until July or August


Offices:
----------------

* Office space is assigned a few weeks before classes

* Offices are shared with 3-4 other first years

Summer Research
----------------------

* Summer research is unlikely before your first year

* For a chance at summer research you should come to the open house with a plan of what you want to do
and talk to the relevant professors then

Open House
--------------------

* It is strongly recommended that you attend the open house. This is a great opportunity to meet with other students
and professors. There is a lot of interaction with the department.

Housing
-------------------

* It is beneficial to find housing as early as possible

	- if you want your own place, this means before June. You will be signing a lease for September.

	- If you want a room in a house, you can wait until later, but it may take a couple tries to get a place.


General Information
--------------------

* Davis has its own wiki that has everything about Davis. Most notably:

	- Apartment complex reviews

	- Internet company reviews

	- Laundromat reviews

	- Restaurant reviews

* If you need information and you haven't gotten a response, don't be afraid to ask twice

* Bring or plan to buy a bike and a U lock

TA Info
---------------

* You need to be TA-ing 25% (5 hours) for your tuition to be waived

* If you have GSR, your advisor has to cover your fees

* You will fill out TA paperwork once you arrive

Classes
-------------

* You will meet with an advisor when you arrive (during orientation) to counsel you on what classes to take
